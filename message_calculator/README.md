# Message Display Calculator

## Description
This unique calculator, called the "Message Display Calculator," is designed to entertain rather than calculate. While it resembles a traditional calculator with a full set of keys, its primary feature is a fun interaction: when users press the "=" button, instead of displaying a calculation result, it shows a pre-set message, "I Miss You".

## Features
- **Simulated Calculator Interface**: Includes a layout of buttons typically found on a standard calculator.
- **Interactive Display**: Shows custom messages based on user interactions. Specifically, pressing "=" changes the display to "I Miss You".
- **Stylish Design**: Crafted using CSS grid and custom properties, featuring a sleek, modern aesthetic.
